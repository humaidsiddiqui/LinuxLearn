    echo command that writes the arguements to standard output!!
    $echo hi 
    $echo x=100
    $echo $x "display 100"
    root has the ultimate priviliges and root assign permissions to access a folder or files
    by typing su you can switch to root user
    su stands for switch user
    $su (asking for password:)
    to set a password type "$su passwd root"
    # means you are in root and to exit type exit
    if you type sudo ls. the output will executed as the root user
    the difference between su and sudo is an admin can give rights to a user without giving them the password to the root account, and can thus take away those rights later on.
    ls will list all the content and if you specify path it will display content int that particular path
    ls -l will list all the contents wil its owner settings,permissions and time stamp.
    ls -a is author flag which let you know the hidden content
    ls --author will display owner
    ls -la (u can use combination of flags also)
    to create a file $ls -laS (pathname) > file.txt
    to view file $vi file.txt  
    cd commands
    cd ~ (directory to home directory) cd / (changes to root directory) cd .. cd "xx yy"
