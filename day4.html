grep command is used to search for a partricular string / word in a text file
similar to "Ctrl+F" but executed via a CLI
$ grep options file1.txt //returns results for matching string options
$ grep -i options file1.txt //returns the rsults for case senstive strings
$ grep -n options file1.txt // returns the matching strings along with their line number 
$ grep - v options file1.txt //returns the result of lines not matching the search strings
$ grep -c options file1.txt // returns the number of lines in which the results match string 
 Working with Sort Commands
 we use sort command to sort the results of a search either aplhabetically or numerically
 $ sort file1.txt // sorts the content of file1.txt and returns them in aplabhetic order
 $ sort file1.txt file2 // sorts the contents of both file1.txt & file2.txt
 $sort -r file1.txt // flag returns in reverse order
 $sort -f file1 // case insensitive sorting -n results asper numerical order
 Working with Pipe "|" command
 it is used to output the result of one command as input to another
 "|" are used to perform two operations in same command
 $ grep dh File1.txt Filex2.txt | sort // searches for string dh from both files and sorts the results
 $ grep dh File1.txt Filex2.txt | sort - //reverse order

 Working with Files & Directories : "cp" Command 
 $ cp [ options ] source destination
 $cp command is used to copy files and instructions
 cp -i enters interactive mode , CLI asks before overwriting Files
 cp -n doesn't overwrite
 cp -u updates destination file only when source file is different from  destination file
 cp -R recursive copy, C oppies even hidden files
 cp - v verbose, prints informative messages
 $ mv [options] source destination
 mv this command is used to move files and direction
 mv -i "interactive" mv -u "updates destination files" mv -v "verbose print source and destination file"
